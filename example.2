Shivaji Maharaj (1630-1680) was a prominent Maratha warrior and the founder of the Maratha Empire in western India.
 Born in Shivneri, Maharashtra, he established a strong military and administrative infrastructure.
 Shivaji was known for his strategic brilliance, guerrilla warfare tactics, and 
innovative military techniques. He pioneered the concept of "swaraj" or self-rule and was a just and benevolent ruler.
 Shivaji's navy, led by his admiral Kanhoji Angre, was a formidable force in the Arabian Sea.
 His coronation in 1674 marked the establishment of the Maratha sovereign state. 
Shivaji's legacy includes his efficient administration, emphasis on religious tolerance,
 and the creation of a robust naval fleet. He remains a revered figure in Indian history
 and a symbol of resistance against foreign domination.
